# Credential Rotation

The Credential Rotation system is a key security feature of the AWS Monitor platform that helps maintain the security of AWS environments by managing and rotating access keys. This document explains how the credential rotation system works.

## Overview

AWS best practices recommend rotating access keys regularly to minimize the risk of compromised credentials. The Credential Rotation Manager provides tools to:

1. Monitor the age and usage of AWS access keys
2. Schedule and perform regular key rotations
3. Alert users when keys need to be rotated
4. Track key rotation history and compliance

## Credential Rotation Flow

The credential rotation process follows these steps:

1. User selects an AWS credential profile for rotation
2. The platform identifies IAM users with active access keys
3. For each selected user, the platform:
   - Creates a new access key
   - Updates applications with the new key (if configured)
   - Deactivates the old key after a verification period
   - Deletes the old key after a safety period
4. The platform records the rotation in the history

## Credential Rotation Manager Component

The Credential Rotation Manager component (`CredentialRotationManager.tsx`) provides a user interface for managing credential rotation:

```jsx
<CredentialRotationManager 
  credentialId={selectedCredentialId}
/>
```

### Features

The Credential Rotation Manager includes:

- **User Selection**: Select which IAM users to include in rotation
- **Rotation Scheduling**: Schedule automated key rotations
- **Key Age Visualization**: Visual indicators of key age and rotation status
- **Rotation History**: View the history of previous key rotations
- **Manual Rotation**: Trigger immediate key rotation for selected users

## Access Key Age Monitoring

The platform continuously monitors the age of access keys:

- **Green**: Keys less than 30 days old
- **Yellow**: Keys between 30-60 days old
- **Orange**: Keys between 60-90 days old
- **Red**: Keys over 90 days old

The dashboard displays key age with color-coded indicators and provides alerts for keys approaching or exceeding rotation thresholds.

## Automated Rotation

The platform supports automated rotation of access keys:

1. User configures rotation schedules in the Credential Rotation Manager
2. The platform schedules rotation tasks based on the configuration
3. When a scheduled rotation occurs, the platform:
   - Initiates the rotation process
   - Sends notification of the rotation
   - Updates the rotation history
   - Verifies the rotation was successful

## Security Considerations

The credential rotation system implements several security measures:

- **Phased Rotation**: New keys are created before old keys are deactivated
- **Verification Period**: Time is allowed to verify new keys are working before deactivating old keys
- **Safety Period**: Deactivated keys are not immediately deleted
- **Audit Trail**: All rotation activities are logged and tracked
- **Failure Recovery**: Process for recovering from failed rotations

## API Endpoints

The credential rotation system uses the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/aws/iam/keys`: Retrieve access key information
- `POST /api/aws/iam/rotate-key`: Initiate key rotation for a user
- `GET /api/aws/iam/rotation-history`: Retrieve key rotation history
- `POST /api/aws/iam/schedule-rotation`: Schedule automated key rotation
